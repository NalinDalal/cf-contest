B. Gorilla and the Exam
time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes
Due to a shortage of teachers in the senior class of the "T-generation", it was
decided to have a huge male gorilla conduct exams for the students. However, it
is not that simple; to prove his competence, he needs to solve the following
problem.

For an array 𝑏
, we define the function 𝑓(𝑏)
 as the smallest number of the following operations required to make the array 𝑏
 empty:

take two integers 𝑙
 and 𝑟
, such that 𝑙≤𝑟
, and let 𝑥
 be the min(𝑏𝑙,𝑏𝑙+1,…,𝑏𝑟)
; then
remove all such 𝑏𝑖
 that 𝑙≤𝑖≤𝑟
 and 𝑏𝑖=𝑥
 from the array, the deleted elements are removed, the indices are renumerated.
You are given an array 𝑎
 of length 𝑛
 and an integer 𝑘
. No more than 𝑘
 times, you can choose any index 𝑖
 (1≤𝑖≤𝑛
) and any integer 𝑝
, and replace 𝑎𝑖
 with 𝑝
.

Help the gorilla to determine the smallest value of 𝑓(𝑎)
 that can be achieved after such replacements.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤104 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers 𝑛
 and 𝑘
 (1≤𝑛≤105
, 0≤𝑘≤𝑛
) — the length of the array 𝑎
 and the maximum number of changes, respectively.

The second line of each set of input data contains 𝑛
 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
 (1≤𝑎𝑖≤109
) — the array 𝑎
 itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of 𝑛
 across all sets of input data does not exceed 105
.

Output
For each set of input data, output a single integer on a separate line — the
smallest possible value of 𝑓(𝑎)
.

Note
In the first set of input data, 𝑓([48843])=1
, since the array consists of a single number, and thus it can be removed in one
operation.

In the second set of input data, you can change the second number to 2
, resulting in the array [2,2,2]
, where 𝑓([2,2,2])=1
, since you can take the entire array as a subarray, the minimum on it is 2
, so we will remove all the 2
s from the array, and the array will become empty.
